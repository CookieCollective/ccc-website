                <p lang="en">The concept is straightforward: an audiovisual compilation on the theme of Divagation.
                Divagation is a attractive starting point, that promotes personal errands; letting everyone's singularity emerge (also, it's a pretty flexible theme ðŸ™Š).</p>
                <p>Some definitions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li lang="en">The act of wandering here and there, out of place.</li>
                    <li lang="en">The action of a mind wandering, wandering at the whim of its _reverie.</li>
                    <li lang="en">The contravention of letting animals wander or abandoning _them on<br> the roads.</li>
                    <li lang="en">Displacement, total or partial, permanent or temporary, of a river bed.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p lang="en">Synonyms: <i>elucubration</i> - <i>extravagance</i> - <i>incoherence</i> - <i>rambling</i> - <i>reverie</i> - <i>daydream</i>.â€™â€™</p>
                <br>
                <p lang="en">In the first act, people created videos. For the second act, others created a soudtrack/music/noise for them.
                Our goal was to create a space of diffusion, for productions/techniques that have few or none, allow encounters to emerge,and foster collaboration between visual art and sound.
                That's how you ended with this U.F.O (Unidentified Freeform Object) lighting up your retina tingling your eardrums.</p>
                <p lang="en">The Cookie Collective is an organization of humans, with de-facto roots since 2016. The collective's core is in France and especially the Greater Paris area.
                Some of us see themselves as technicians; some as artists; some keep pondering this existential question, while others just don't ask.
                From a focus on realtime visual art, over the last 3 years the musical dimension grew bigger in our collective's works.
                For this project, we want to bring back the visual to the front stage. A kind of Travel through Time, or rather to an alternative Present which honors the first years of the ollective, a salute to our livecoding pioneers.</p>
