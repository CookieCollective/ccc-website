                <p lang="en">The concept is straightforward: an audiovisual compilation centered around a main theme: Divagation.
                    Divagation is an intriguing starting point that encourages personal exploration, allowing each individualâ€™s
                    peculiarity to shine through. Itâ€™s also a remarkably versatile theme ðŸ™Š.</p>

                <p lang="en">At first, people created videos and then some other people composed music or noise fitting for them.
                Our goal was to create a broadcasting space for productions and/or techniques that do not have one (or not enough).
                We are trying to bring people together, to foster collaboration between visual and sonic arts.
                That's how you ended up viewing this U.F.O (Unidentified Freeform Object), lighting up your retina and tingling your eardrums.</p>

                <p lang="en">The Cookie Collective is a human organization in existence, de-facto, since 2016. Most of the members are based in
                    France, especially in the Greater Paris area. Some of us see themselves as technicians; some as artists; some keep pondering
                    this existential question. Others just don't care asking themselves the question. The collective once focused on realtime
                    visual arts. However, the last three years saw a great development of the musical dimension of our collective work.
                    This project aims to bring back the visual aspect to the front of the stage. It's a kind of travel through time, or rather
                    to an alternative present which honors the first years of the collective, a tribute to our livecoding pioneers.</p>
