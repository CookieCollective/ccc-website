        The concept is straightforward: an audiovisual compilation on the theme of Divagation.<br>
        Divagation is a attractive starting point, that promotes personal errands; letting everyone's singularity emerge (also, it's a pretty flexible theme ðŸ™Š)<br>
        <br>
        Some definitions:<br>
        <br>
        _The act of wandering here and there, out of place.<br>
        _The action of a mind wandering, wandering at the whim of its _reverie.<br>
        _The contravention of letting animals wander or abandoning _them on the roads.<br>
        _Displacement, total or partial, permanent or temporary, of a river bed.<br>
        <br>
        Synonyms: elucubration - extravagance - incoherence - rambling - reverie - daydream.â€™â€™<br>
        <br>
        In the first act, people created videos.<br>
        For the second act, others created a soudtrack/music/noise for them.<br>
        <br>
        Our goal was to create a space of diffusion, for productions/techniques that have few or none, allow encounters to emerge, and foster collaboration between visual art and sound.<br>
        <br>
        That's how you ended with this U.F.O (Unidentified Freeform Object) lighting up your retina & tingling your eardrums.<br>
        <br>
        The Cookie Collective is an organization of humans, with de-facto roots since 2016. The collective's core is in France and especially the Greater Paris area.<br>
        Some of us see themselves as technicians; some as artists; some keep pondering this existential question, while others just don't ask.<br>
        From a focus on realtime visual art, over the last 3 years the musical dimension grew bigger in our collective's works.<br>
        For this project, we want to bring back the visual to the front stage. A kind of Travel through Time, or rather to an alternative Present which honors the first years of the ollective, a salute to our livecoding pioneers.</p>
