I am a first-grade student at the Strzeminski Academy of Art in Lodz, where I am pursuing a degree in New Media. This program has introduced me to the world of creative coding, and despite being relatively new to this field, I am deeply passionate about exploring its possibilities.  Art has been a significant part of my life for as long as I can remember, and discovering the intersection of art and technology has been a transformative experience for me. Embracing new ways to express my creativity through coding has reignited my passion for art, making me feel rejuvenated and inspired to push the boundaries of my artistic journey.
