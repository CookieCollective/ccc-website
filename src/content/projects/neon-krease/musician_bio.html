Since 2022, Krease has been exploring live coding with an innovative approach. He started at Stereolux in Nantes, where he discovered the possibilities of live coding by combining music and programming. Initially, he used Ableton, but gradually evolved towards tools like PureData and PlugData before focusing on SuperCollider and Sardine.<br>
<br>
His current approach is distinguished by the use of a micro-computer for lightweight travel, a transition motivated by the breakdown of his laptop. Krease is working on an ambitious project: encapsulating complete tracks in Python functions while optimizing the code structure for quick and efficient use in live coding.<br>
<br>
For sound design, he experiments with granular synthesizers and serial effects to create unique sound textures. The idea is to go beyond standard usual codes and explore new musical techniques, while remaining rigorous in respecting the criteria of drum'n'bass and experimental neurobass.<br>
<br>
Creative process:<br>
For his latest track, Krease started with REAPER and BESPOKE on a micro-computer with limited power. BESPOKE quickly confronted him with CPU and RAM limitations, especially with multiple VSTi. Additionally, manually configuring MIDI devices was quite time-consuming.<br>
<br>
He then moved to Pure Data and PlugData. Although PlugData's modular aspect was interesting, he encountered similar CPU limitations, and manual programming was quite complex.<br>
<br>
Next, he discovered that plugins used in PlugData also work in SuperCollider. Using SuperCollider in headless mode with Sardine, he was able to integrate and manage functions more efficiently. Sardine was crucial for encapsulating functions and organizing pattern arrays, even though the Swim function he used doesn't directly handle syncopation but facilitates pattern management.<br>
<br>
For this track, he explored using syncopation to align rhythms with the drum and bass style and began creating drum patterns that gradually launch. He also watched many learning videos on this musical style, techniques, and synthesizers used for inspiration. This took time but was very enriching.<br>
<br>
Additionally, he found a method to create automations, marking the beginning of a new adventure in his creative process. The project is still in development, and he plans to add sound design techniques to enrich the track. In the future, he also wants to integrate Processing to control visuals in sync with the music.<br>

In parallel, Krease draws inspiration from Afrofuturism and technology to enrich his music, constantly seeking innovative ways to create captivating sound experiences.
