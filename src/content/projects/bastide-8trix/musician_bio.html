8rix is an artist from Paris who uses his phone to make chiptune music, melted with everyday sounds he records on-the-fly.<br> As a music enthusiast he likes to put some hip-hop, grime, ambient or latino influence among four-on-the-floor tracks. His universe is an unexpected assembly of station announcements, birds singing, reverberated voices, distorted and pitched sounds, children construction games, where trains go on their rails endlessly.<br>When on stage he works with LimeLimeWire, a multi-gifted artist and ally whose hypnotizing visuals perfectly fit his music.
