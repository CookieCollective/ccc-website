Short description: Live coded CSS in the train to Stockholm.
Long description: During a train trip from Narvik (NO) to Stockholm (SE), I shot a 5 minutes uncut footage of the landscape I traveled through. Then I made an HTML page with the resulting video as a background and improvised a CSS animated composition over it. The CSS is live-coded in the Firefox browserâ€™s developer panel as long as the video is played.
