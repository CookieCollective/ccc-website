<b>Software:</b> Processing
<b>Description of project:</b><br>I created a generative kinetic projection that generates in real time based on the code I wrote in the Processing environment. The work consists of many deformed circles. Their number and appearance change while generating the projection, but within the ranges I set. The size of the shapes tries to align with an invisible circle that changes its size from time to time. The use of randomness helped me achieve unpredictable and very diverse effects. The projection can be displayed on any size display because it is responsive. However, it looks best when presented on a larger scale (e.g. 170 x 170 cm) using a projector on a wall or on a clean white canvas hung on a wall.
<b>Description of my idea:</b><br>When creating this project, I focused on divagation, understood as deviating from the topic during a conversation, because when we translate this word into my native language (Polish), this is its main meaning.<br>The deformed circles visible in the projection represent various topics that appear during the conversation. The more the topics differ from each other, the more visible are the differences between the shapes (degree of deformation, size, color). The main meaning of the conversation may change over time, and so does the size of the circle to which all shapes strive.
*The recordings and photos I have attached are sample parts of the projection. Work has no defined beginning and end. It’s not an animation. It’s a generative kinetic image.
