This was recorded in a single take the 14th of april, to keep it «natural» and organic and balance the eclecticism of the video. Arvo Part (Dies Irae) inspired the main theme. It’s just an F minor chord, across a cloud and few VCOs. When the video is more abstract, some FM gets added and makes the thing more gritty and nervous.  Very little post-processing was done, just some dynamic treatments using some compressor and adding more reverb to get the stereo more immersive and spacious (the single track was fully mono otherwise, even though it had some spectral delay treatment from the custom DSP (some modded firmware based on Mutable instruments Cloud module) running in the Daisy Patch) Eurorack = Lifeforms SV1 oscillators, hermod for the midi-CV conversion, and a doepfer EG controlling the Lifeforms’ lowpass filter, that’s basically it.  Mixing/syncing/recording  = I use reaper for this kind of task,  the eurorack track is going through Adam Szabo Solaris VST (it’s pretty cool and deep, and it’s free (not FOSS though) was up during the take as it adds a lot of depth, the track went through SSL buss compressor*, and ProQ3 set to dynamic EQ in order to prevent the upper-mids from being too annoying when listened to loud.<br>I also added a kick drum sample in order to have a clear “boom” when the 2nd part of the video kicks in, it’s going through a long reverb and Moog filter*.<br>The master goes in the precision maximizer* *those plugin are from UAD Here's a picture of  my system as patched when recording the piece.
