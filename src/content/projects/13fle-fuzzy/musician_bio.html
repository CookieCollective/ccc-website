I live in Aubervilliers 93, in France, near the canal. (he/him)<br></br>I was inspired by the video, but my inspiration for the music was from listening to a lot of contemporary/post-romantic music (Debussy, Rhys Chatham and Arvo Part) in the past 2 weeks and some circa-2015 NL drum n bass this morning.
