I am hardly ever funny when I try.. <br>
But here is what I came up with :<br>
I spend the afternoon drifting on the surface of the water in a lake. It's the moste pure thing I did today and I was acctually doing nothing. This is my daily hydrofeministic movement poetry. I tried to sing underwater as well while I was diving. Ain't that easy. Underwater is the moste inspiring environment for me this days.
