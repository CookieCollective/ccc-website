<b>(he/them)<br><br>Artist statement</b>
Being born in Russia to a Ukrainian family into the aftermath of the Soviet Unionâ€™s collapse and later migrating to Europe with no possibility of returning, has defined my work for many years, permeating it with a sense of displacement and dispossession, while also fuelling my fascination with transient, shifting identities inherent in sound.
Beginning my artistic career as a jazz musician, I worked in a variety of projects ranging from classical and baroque music to experimental jazz and free improvisation. In recent years I prefer to work on sound art or improvise in smaller groups of electro-acoustic musicians. My approach combines field recording with hand-crafted audio-processing tolls in Pure Data.
