link to interactive version of work and code (works only in chrome)<a href='https://editor.p5js.org/daria.luka.kontakt/full/OK_zZB0yj'>link</a> 
I'm excited to share my interactive work, crafted using an open-source, freely available JavaScript-based program called P5.js. Within this framework, I utilize a voice recognition library built upon Google Chrome's mechanisms for speech recognition.
Here's how it works: The program listens to what you say, displays the message, then translateseach world into "bla" to expres pointlessnes of divagations. After that each element has the freedom to move and wander in directions of its own choosing.
To enhance readability and maintain interest, after a brief pause in speech, a new divagation begins, introducing a change in the font style of the messages.
