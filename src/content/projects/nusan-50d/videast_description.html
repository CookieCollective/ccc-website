<b>CCC Nusan 2024<br>Pixelated bad dream</b>
I'm using a "fantasy console" called TIC-80, which is open source and lets you make tiny retro games or animations using LUA<br>TIC-80 limits you to a resolution of 240x136 and only 16 colors palette, but there is a trick I use to change the palette before each scanline, so you can have a lot more colors on screen. <br>All my effects use some sort of remanence, that is not clearing the screen fully at the start of the frame, but keeping whatever is there, and only changing a few pixels per frame to a darker color, so things fade to black slowly. This lets me blend all my effects together while providing an interesting texture to everything.<br>I’m using a specific version of TIC-80 dedicated to live coding, where an FFT of the background sound is available, letting you make audio-reactives effects.<br>I made the final video in two steps, I first improvised several effects in TIC-80 that react on music and then I recorded them playing while putting some background music and live changing the sound’s volume to influence the level of the FFT and so the “intensity” of my effects, I made several recordings until I was satisfied with the result
