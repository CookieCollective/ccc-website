I mostly worked by watching and rewatching Nusan's videos, imagining sounds and instruments that could match several features of her visual composition. For example, plucked square wave notes that represent the squared "rain drops", or plucked sinwave notes when circle sprites.<br>The lush parts of the video composition inspired me a cinematic bright orchestral string ensemble, that became a huge part of the finished soundtrack, especially in the chillest parts of the video, contrasting with the more intenses parts where I assembled some more danceable shuffled drum breaks, matching with the visually busier mood of these parts.<br>I noticed that Nusan also put some video glitch effects on top of her composition, which I synced with some bitcrush FX applied on the whole composition.<br>Then, I found that the animated wave that grows to a wide abstract tornado (that inspired me the string parts) was lacking some sound design to match its visual language. So I added some filtered white noise synced to its animation to create a strong wind effect, reminding the sound of some slightly hostile storm replaced by the brigher and dreamy strings arrangement that predate in most parts of the composition.
On a more technical side note, I used TouchDesigner to help me sync the video to my Bitwig composition, by creating a very tiny patch to retrieve the DAW timecode and play Nusan's video synced in realtime along the audio track playhead.
