French bass music DJ and producer. More DJ than producer tbh.Heavily inspired by slick drum&bass, dumb dubstep and hard bass, fun uk garage, glittery hyperpop and bass music tracks that tell stories without words. Of course, you can hardly find any of that in the work I submitted to CCC, but that's ok.
