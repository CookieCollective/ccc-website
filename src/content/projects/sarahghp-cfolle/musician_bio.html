I have right now a median of 43 minutes daily screen time on Instagram <br>
and <br>
7073 Unread mails <br>
and <br>
33 Spams <br>
and <br>
I received a like from a comment I posted on YouTube 9 days ago, <br>
by the way, <br>
The last bookmark is a <a href='https://youtube.com/watch?v=JBUHDvY60l0'>YouTube video</a> titled "How to spot Generative AI? (even if it has all 10 fingers and toes)" <br>
but <br>
I love music <br>
and <br>
SOMEONE just liked a message I sent <br>
and <br>
I have 69 tabs open right ( there's usually more >:) )
