<b>Scribble process</b><br>This video is a combined softwareâ€“hardware project, with a computer-generated live sketch fed into an analog framebuffer for manipulation. (See images.)
<b>Software</b><br>The base sketch is driven by La Habra, a Clojurescript framework I wrote to help write SVGs live. The project also makes use of VDMX to handle routing the video out of the laptop.

<b>Hardware</b><br>The software sketch is converted from HDMI to the Eurorack 1V format demanded by the LZX Memory Palace, a digital-analog framebuffer and effects unit. This conversion process goes through a Blackmagic HDMI to SDI mini-converter and the Blackmagic SDI to Analog converter. This signal is then sent into the LZX TBC2 for conversion to the 1V signal.
