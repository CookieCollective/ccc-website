I’m using hydra to generate my visual, calling as function some patches that I’m familiar and comfortable with and then blending/mixing them together.<br>I like to reach the point where it’s difficult to grasp the start of the pattern.<br>However not too much randomness, I want it to be fluid and somehow organic.<br>Lately I’m always trying to create visuals that can recall the outer space and I thought it could fit with the theme of “divagation”.
