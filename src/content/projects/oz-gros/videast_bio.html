Hi, my name is Lorenzo. I was born in Ravenna, Italy, but I’m actually living in Antwerp, Belgium.<br>I’m a musician and I got in contact with creative coding during my master in “Live Electronics” at the Antwerpen’s conservatoire. One of the main classes was about coding and my teacher introduced me to Hydra while I was trying to develop some visuals for my music.<br>At the moment I’m performing as Oz’n’Roll both for music and visuals, using a mix of coding (sonic Pi and Hydra) and hardware synths.
