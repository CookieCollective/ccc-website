Inspiration: The concept for "Aqueous Divagation" was born from a desire to evoke a watery effect within an interconnected pixel network, aligning with theme of divagation. Prototype code: The prototype focused on reducing pixeel count for performance, incorporating PVector dynamics, and establishing dynamic connections. Forces were applied between connected pixels, resulting in smooth but chaotic effect.
