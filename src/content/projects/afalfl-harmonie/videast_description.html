J’ai souhaité explorer le thème de l’open call CCC “divagation’’ par le prisme du mot Anthropocene.<br>The Anthropocene is a new geological epoch characterized by the advent of humans as the main force of change on Earth, surpassing geophysical forces. This is the age of humans! That of an unprecedented planetary disorder.<br>But this word “Anthropocene” – not a concept! – does it simply take its place in the long list by which cultures and societies attempted to express the spiritual situation of an era? Or does it make a leap that is both qualitative and quantitative, linking natural history and history in an unprecedented way?
By saying that “we are in the Anthropocene”, what are we saying? This statement formulates a diagnostic ambition. It also calls for a polemical discussion. A diagnostic word, the word “Anthropocene” translates the superb and painful memory that the Earth keeps of the passage of humans. This neologism uses the radical “cene” which, in geology, designates the Cenozoic eras, such as the Pleistocene or the Holocene.
