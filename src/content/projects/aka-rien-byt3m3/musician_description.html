I chose to make music for RAS dans le caison<br>
My song is called Ethereal, I felt it went with the slow moving forms and images in the video.<br>
For the video I started with trying to find sounds and samples that fit the mood. Usually I pick stuff from youtube or other sources and slice them up in an editor (AudioCataylist) and then bring them into Milky Tracker or Renoise (tracker programs). I grew up using early trackers on the Amiga and early PCs.<br>
Once I had the sounds and samples I liked, I started to lay down the beat and drums. I try to block out the time of the video and create changes based as needed. Next I'd slowly edit sections or looping parts as the video progressed.<br>
The rest is iterative editing and tweaking till I felt it sounded good and matched what I saw. The pink colors and slowly moving forms made me feel a deep bass and ethereal chimes and bells, as if a daydream.
