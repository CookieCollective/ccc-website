I am a foolish programmer, and computer nerd who grew up with a Commodore 64 and Amiga 500. I started to make weird music and noise with early tracker programs, even getting some music into videos games in college.
I work as a web developer in Washington DC, and code shaders in my spare time when not making music. New to the demoscene even though I feel like I’ve been around it all my life.
Keyboard fanatic, loves tiny computers and new technology, I’m not smart but brute force/hacc my life to the fullest.
