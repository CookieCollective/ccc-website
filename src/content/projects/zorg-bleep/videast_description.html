This visual experience was assembled using multiple glsl shaders I did (some older and some new).<br>It was done as a tribute to a demoscene pice I love from MFX and Kewlers band. We find many classic visuals of the demoscene culture, checkerboard, chromatic aberrations, raymarching, glow... which is really enjoyable to create with pure shaders. It was all done in shader, it can be found <a href='https://www.shadertoy.com/view/43XSz7'>here</a>.
