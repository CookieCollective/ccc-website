I picked up the invite from Azertype to make something for your zine and if Azertype asks you deliver. But I wanted to challenge myself. When I make music, I worked mostly with<br>ORCA<br>ORCA and I felt it's time to broaden my horizon. So, for this project I used Mercury. It was on my radar for a while, because Timo Hoogland made it and he is from our local scene, that being in The Netherlands.<br>I do find importance in using tools that have been made by local developers. So, for me this call was a great motivation to learn a new tool and deliver a creative piece of sound with it.<br>For a live coding language, it feels nice and straight forward. I felt it was accessible.  Sound wise I was looking for something weird and outer-spacy, but also something cold. Because z0rg's video play's trough this weird 3d rendered liminal demo-scene kind of space. This is the feeling I was getting.<br>Even though there are a lot of lights I just couldn't make any sense of it. It kept feeling cold and weird. I did go for some Gameboy Advance synth sounds. Because the fish was also levelling up at some point.<br>It just made me think of all the hours playing Pok√©mon and other RPG's on the GBA and the sounds that accompanied these weird type vaguely familiar creatures.  In the end I would would call this sound Limenal Goofy, cause that wat the video and the sound is. It's goofy and it moves trough a liminal space.
