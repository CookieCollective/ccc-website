Statement<br>I work from playful experimentation with technology that I can intervene in and reappropriate, such as computers or obsolete video games, software and hardware that allow creative freedoms through programming, modularization, or the construction of new objects. Thus, I explore the particularities of a variety of techniques such as live coding, soundscapes, circuit bending, video games, 3D printing, 3D modeling, circuit construction, programming, video art, glitch, etc. At the same time, I reclaim manual tasks such as blacksmithing, carpentry, sewing, or screen printing, which leads me to prioritize their unexpected potentials and then work on the relationships - whether of tension or articulation - between them.<br> This eclectic and voracious search is carefully materialized, generating tension between the minimalism of gestures and the volatility of experimentation.<br>I am characterized by uncertainty and impermanence, concepts that contradict the productivist tendencies associated with new technologies. I do not attempt to generate spectacle in my works, but still perceive in the viewers a sense of wonder or enjoyment of the strangeness when immersing themselves in the almost fantastical yet very real worlds that I am creating. Although I consider myself a politicized person, it is not evidently easy to trace specific topics of interest in my work, although they are always present in one way or another.
