<b>::PROCESS::</b>
<b>::colon::</b> is a visual live coding environment developed by the audiovisual artist <b>GRAIN noir</b> (<a href='https://grain-noir.com/'>https://grain-noir.com/</a>) initially for <b>Tokyo Algorave</b> (<a href='https://algorave.tokyo/'>https://algorave.tokyo/</a>).
The software is developed with <b>Three.js</b>, a cross-browser <b>JavaScript</b> library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using <b>WebGL</b>.
The session starts by logging in the terminal before accessing the <b>::colon::</b> interface. The UI is inspired by minimal terminal interfaces and is composed of the following elements:<br>- <b>input terminal</b>: this is where the user enter commands<br>- <b>log</b>: display command helper and system logs<br>- <b>signal</b>: show the raw PCM audio data if audio input is enabled<br>- <b>debug</b> (optional): display camera and objects in debug mode
The commands are used to interact with 3D primitive shapes in the environment (box, sphere, plane) called <I><b>artifacts</b></I>, properties such as position, rotation, scale, colors, amount, resolution, draw mode can be set through the <I><b>create</b></I> command.
The <I><b>goto</b></I> command is the vessel of this 3D exploration system: the camera can indeed be animated to move toward created artifacts or position by specifying an object index, a vector and a duration through the <I><b>goto</b></I> command.
On top of these commands, the audio input can be enabled to map scene parameters to the live raw <b>audio data</b>. The WebGL rendered can also be switched to <b>ASCII mode</b> in order to display the 3D render using characters and symbols.
See the documentation for the complete list of commands and parameter types.
